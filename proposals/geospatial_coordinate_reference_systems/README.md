## Introduction

This proposal introduces first-class support for
**Geospatial Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)** in OpenUSD.
It defines two new schemas that allow USD scenes to declare
*where on Earth* their 3D content is located,
enabling interoperability with GIS, AECO, digital twin,
and simulation workflows that require real-world positioning.

The core idea is simple:
a CRS definition is stored as an OGC WKT string on a typed prim,
and an applied API schema binds that CRS to any `UsdGeomXformable` prim
in the scene hierarchy.
Child prims inherit their parent's CRS binding,
and a runtime reprojection pipeline transforms geometry
between different CRS zones within a single composed stage.

This proposal is the result of collaborative work
within the AOUSD Geospatial Working Group,
with contributions from Esri, Pixar, NVIDIA, Bentley, and Trimble.

## Motivation

### The geospatial gap in OpenUSD

OpenUSD provides a powerful scene description framework
with rich support for geometry, materials, lighting, and physics.
However, it currently has no mechanism to express
*where a scene is located on the Earth's surface*.

A building model authored in USD can describe its shape,
appearance, and internal structure in exquisite detail —
but there is no standard way to say
"this building sits at 34.0561°N, 117.1956°W"
or "these coordinates are in UTM zone 11N."

This is not a niche requirement.
Every AECO project, every digital twin,
every GIS visualization, and every urban simulation
needs to place 3D content at real-world coordinates.
Without a standard mechanism, each tool and pipeline
invents its own custom metadata,
leading to data loss at interchange boundaries
and preventing true interoperability.

### The expanding scope of USD

USD was originally designed for film production workflows,
where scenes exist in an abstract coordinate space
and absolute position on the Earth is irrelevant.

As USD adoption expands into AECO, GIS, defense, simulation,
and digital twin applications through the AOUSD alliance,
the need for geospatial positioning has become critical.
These industries routinely work with coordinate reference systems,
and their tools (ArcGIS, QGIS, FME, Bentley, Trimble, etc.)
all expect CRS metadata on imported geometry.

The glTF format has already recognized this need
with its own geospatial extension proposal.
IFC 5 is evaluating USD as a potential foundation.
OpenUSD must provide a standard answer
to the question "where is this scene?"

## Problem statement

### Placing 3D content on the Earth

To place a 3D model at a real-world location, three things are needed:

1. **A Coordinate Reference System (CRS)** that defines
   the mathematical relationship between coordinates and positions
   on the Earth's surface (e.g., "UTM zone 11N" or "WGS 84 geographic").

2. **Coordinates** in that CRS
   (e.g., Easting = 481,948.63 m, Northing = 3,768,393.52 m).

3. **A binding mechanism** that associates the CRS
   with the geometry in the scene graph.

USD currently provides none of these as first-class features.
Users must fall back to custom metadata, primvars,
or out-of-band sidecar files to convey this information —
all of which are opaque to USD's composition engine,
rendering pipeline, and standard tooling.

### Why this matters now

1. **Data loss at interchange boundaries.**
   CRS metadata stored in `customData` or proprietary attributes
   is routinely stripped during USD export/import cycles
   across different tools.

2. **No standard for CRS inheritance.**
   Without a defined inheritance model,
   every prim in a large scene must redundantly carry CRS metadata,
   or tools must implement ad-hoc resolution logic.

3. **Precision hazards.**
   Geographic coordinates (e.g., UTM easting of 481,948 m)
   exceed the useful range of `float32`.
   Without guidance, implementations store these values
   in `point3f` arrays, causing visible jitter and drift.

4. **Multi-CRS composition is undefined.**
   Real-world projects routinely combine data from different CRS zones
   (e.g., a cross-state pipeline project spanning UTM zones 11 and 12).
   There is no mechanism to compose these into a single USD stage
   with correct spatial alignment.

5. **Industry adoption is blocked.**
   GIS vendors, AECO tool makers, and digital twin platforms
   cannot fully adopt USD without a standard way to express CRS,
   because it is a foundational requirement for their workflows.

## Background: Coordinate Reference Systems

This section provides context for readers unfamiliar with geospatial concepts.

### Geographic vs. Projected CRS

A **Geographic CRS** uses angular coordinates
(latitude and longitude in degrees)
on a mathematical model of the Earth's shape (an ellipsoid).
Example: WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) — the CRS used by GPS.

A **Projected CRS** mathematically projects
the curved Earth surface onto a flat 2D plane.
Coordinates are linear (metres or feet).
Example: UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611) — used for Southern California.

Every projected CRS contains a base geographic CRS,
a projection method (e.g., Transverse Mercator, Lambert Conformal Conic),
and projection parameters (central meridian, scale factor, false easting, etc.).

### CRS encodings: OGC WKT, EPSG, and WKID

There are several ways to identify a CRS:

| Encoding | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **EPSG code** | Integer ID from the IOGP geodesy registry | `32611` |
| **WKID** | Well-Known ID — same concept, used by Esri (includes Esri-specific codes beyond EPSG) | `32611` |
| **OGC WKT** | Self-contained text string defining the full CRS (ISO 19162:2019) | `PROJCRS["WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N", ...]` |
| **PROJ string** | Compact string for the PROJ library | `+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84` |

This proposal uses **OGC WKT 2** (ISO 19162:2019)
as the canonical CRS encoding,
with EPSG authority identifiers embedded within the WKT via `ID["EPSG", code]`.

### 3D CRS types

All CRS definitions in this proposal must be 3D.
The supported types are:

| Type | WKT Keyword | Axes | Example |
|------|-------------|------|---------|
| 3D Projected | `COMPOUNDCRS` (PROJCRS + VERTCRS) | Easting, Northing, Up | NAD83 / UTM 11N + NAVD88 height |
| 3D Geographic | `GEOGCRS` with 3 axes | Lat, Lon, Height | WGS 84 (EPSG:4979) |
| 3D Geocentric (ECEF) | `GEODCRS` | X, Y, Z | ITRF2020 |
| 3D Engineering / Local | `DERIVEDPROJCRS` | Local X, Y, Z | Site calibration grid |

For dynamic datums (time-dependent reference frames),
WKT 2 supports the `COORDINATEMETADATA` wrapper
with `FRAMEEPOCH` and `EPOCH` clauses
for high-precision applications.

## Design overview

### Principles

1. **Industry agnosticism.**
   The CRS mechanism must serve GIS, AECO, M&E, simulation,
   and defense equally — no single industry's conventions are privileged.

2. **Self-contained CRS definitions.**
   A USD file must carry all information needed to interpret its coordinates
   without relying on external registry lookups at runtime.

3. **Composition-friendly.**
   CRS definitions and bindings must compose correctly
   through all USD composition arcs (references, sublayers, inherits, etc.).

4. **Inheritance.**
   Child prims should inherit their parent's CRS,
   just as they inherit material bindings.
   Overrides at any level in the hierarchy are supported.

5. **Precision-aware.**
   The design must address the float32 limitation
   of `point3f` geometry by separating large geospatial offsets
   (double-precision transforms) from local vertex positions (single-precision).

6. **Minimal disruption.**
   No changes to existing USD schemas or core APIs.
   The geospatial schemas are additive and optional.

7. **Extensible.**
   Third-party CRS libraries (PROJ, GDAL, Esri, Trimble)
   are abstracted behind an internal API.
   OpenUSD itself does not validate or interpret WKT strings.

8. **Interoperable.**
   The design should facilitate round-trip exchange
   with glTF (geospatial extension), IFC, CityGML, and OGC 3D Tiles.

### Schema design

Two new schemas are introduced:

| Schema | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GeospatialCRS` | Typed (IsA) | Defines a CRS as a first-class USD prim |
| `GeospatialCRSBindingAPI` | Applied (HasA) | Binds a CRS prim to a `UsdGeomXformable` |

This two-schema approach separates the CRS *definition*
from the CRS *usage*,
allowing a single CRS definition to be shared
across many prims and scenes via USD references.

### CRS library pattern

CRS definitions are intended to live in shared **library layers**
(e.g., `crs_library.usda`) that can be referenced by any scene:

```
crs_library.usda
├── /CRS/WGS84_UTM11N       (GeospatialCRS)
├── /CRS/NAD83_UTM11N        (GeospatialCRS)
├── /CRS/NAD83_CA_Zone5      (GeospatialCRS)
└── /CRS/WGS84_Geographic3D  (GeospatialCRS)
```

This pattern is analogous to shared material libraries in M&E workflows.
Authoring tools can ship standard CRS libraries,
and users can create custom ones for local/site-specific CRS definitions.

### CRS binding and inheritance

The `GeospatialCRSBindingAPI` is applied to a `UsdGeomXformable` prim
and references a `GeospatialCRS` prim (from the same stage or an external layer).

CRS bindings inherit down the prim hierarchy.
A prim without a direct CRS binding
resolves its CRS by walking up to the nearest ancestor
that has one — analogous to `UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI` resolution.

A child prim may override its parent's CRS
by applying its own `GeospatialCRSBindingAPI` with a different CRS reference.
This is how multi-CRS scenes are composed
(e.g., one subtree in UTM zone 11N, another in UTM zone 18N).

### Precision handling

USD mesh geometry uses `point3f[]` (float32),
which provides ~7 decimal digits of precision.
A UTM easting of 481,948.63 requires 8+ significant digits,
so storing geospatial coordinates directly in `point3f` causes visible artifacts.

The solution is a two-tier approach:

| Tier | Data | Type | Precision |
|------|------|------|-----------|
| **Anchor** | Geospatial position | `double3 xformOp:translate` | float64 (~15 digits) |
| **Detail** | Mesh vertices | `point3f[] points` | float32 (~7 digits) |

The large CRS coordinates are carried in the double-precision
`xformOp:translate` on the CRS-bound `Xform` prim.
Mesh vertex positions are small offsets (typically < 1 km)
relative to that anchor, staying well within float32 range.

### Target CRS and runtime reprojection

The **Target CRS** for a stage is defined by the CRS
bound to the composed `defaultPrim` of the root layer stack.

At render/query time, all prims whose bound CRS
differs from the Target CRS are **reprojected** —
their transforms are mathematically converted
from the source CRS to the Target CRS.

This reprojection is implemented as a
**Hydra 2.0 Scene Index Filter** (for rendering)
and as API methods (for computation),
using an abstracted interface to third-party CRS libraries
(PROJ, GDAL, Esri projection engine, etc.).

## Detailed design

### GeospatialCRS typed schema

A concrete typed schema that defines a CRS as a first-class USD prim.

**Prim type name:** `CoordinateReferenceSystem`

**Attributes:**

| Attribute | API Name | Type | Variability | Description |
|-----------|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `crs:wkt` | `wellKnownText` | `uniform token` | Uniform | OGC WKT 2 string (ISO 19162:2019) defining the CRS |

The `crs:wkt` attribute is `uniform` because a CRS definition
does not vary over time or across a mesh.
It is a `token` (not `string`) to enable efficient caching and comparison.

**USDA syntax:**

```usda
def CoordinateReferenceSystem "WGS84_UTM11N" (
    doc = "WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611)"
)
{
    uniform token crs:wkt = """PROJCRS["WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N",
        BASEGEOGCRS["WGS 84",
            DATUM["World Geodetic System 1984",
                ELLIPSOID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
                    LENGTHUNIT["metre",1.0]]],
            PRIMEMERIDIAN["Greenwich",0,
                ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],
            ID["EPSG",4326]],
        CONVERSION["UTM zone 11N",
            METHOD["Transverse Mercator",
                ID["EPSG",9807]],
            PARAMETER["Latitude of natural origin",0,
                ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433],
                ID["EPSG",8801]],
            PARAMETER["Longitude of natural origin",-117,
                ANGLEUNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433],
                ID["EPSG",8802]],
            PARAMETER["Scale factor at natural origin",0.9996,
                SCALEUNIT["unity",1.0],
                ID["EPSG",8805]],
            PARAMETER["False easting",500000,
                LENGTHUNIT["metre",1.0],
                ID["EPSG",8806]],
            PARAMETER["False northing",0,
                LENGTHUNIT["metre",1.0],
                ID["EPSG",8807]]],
        CS[Cartesian,2],
            AXIS["(E)",east,ORDER[1],
                LENGTHUNIT["metre",1.0]],
            AXIS["(N)",north,ORDER[2],
                LENGTHUNIT["metre",1.0]],
        ID["EPSG",32611]]"""
}
```

**C++ API:**

```cpp
class UsdGeospatialCoordinateReferenceSystem : public UsdTyped {
public:
    static UsdGeospatialCoordinateReferenceSystem
    Define(const UsdStagePtr &stage, const SdfPath &path);

    static UsdGeospatialCoordinateReferenceSystem
    Get(const UsdStagePtr &stage, const SdfPath &path);

    UsdAttribute GetWellKnownTextAttr() const;
    UsdAttribute CreateWellKnownTextAttr(
        VtValue const &defaultValue = VtValue(),
        bool writeSparsely = false) const;

    /// Walk up the prim hierarchy from `prim` and return the WKT token
    /// of the first ancestor (or self) with a valid crs:wkt attribute.
    static TfToken ComputeCoordinateReferenceSystem(UsdPrim const &prim);
};
```

### GeospatialCRSBindingAPI applied schema

A single-apply API schema that binds a CRS to a `UsdGeomXformable` prim.

**Schema type name:** `BindingAPI`
**Can only apply to:** `Xformable`

**Behavior:**

When `Bind()` is called, the schema:
1. Adds a USD **reference** to the specified `GeospatialCRS` prim
   (internal or external).
2. Calls `SetResetXformStack()` on the prim,
   ensuring `!resetXformStack!` appears in the `xformOpOrder`,
   so the prim's `xformOp:translate` is interpreted
   as an absolute position in the bound CRS.

**C++ API:**

```cpp
class UsdGeospatialBindingAPI : public UsdAPISchemaBase {
public:
    static UsdGeospatialBindingAPI Apply(const UsdPrim &prim);
    static bool CanApply(const UsdPrim &prim,
                         std::string *whyNot = nullptr);

    /// Bind via internal reference to a CRS prim on the same stage.
    bool Bind(UsdGeospatialCoordinateReferenceSystem const &crs) const;

    /// Bind via external reference to a CRS prim in another layer.
    bool Bind(std::string const &layerPath,
              SdfPath const &crsPrimPath) const;
};
```

### Complete scene example

The following example places a simplified building
at the Esri headquarters in Redlands, California (34.0561°N, 117.1956°W),
using WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N (EPSG:32611).

```usda
#usda 1.0
(
    defaultPrim = "World"
    metersPerUnit = 1
    upAxis = "Z"
)

# ── Stage root: CRS-bound to UTM 11N ────────────────────────────────
def Xform "World" (
    apiSchemas = ["GeospatialCRSBindingAPI"]
    references = [@./crs_library.usda@</CRS/WGS84_UTM11N>]
)
{
    uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["!resetXformStack!", "xformOp:translate"]

    # Esri HQ — UTM 11N coordinates (metres)
    double3 xformOp:translate = (481948.63, 3768393.52, 400)

    # ── Building inherits CRS from /World ────────────────────────────
    def Xform "EsriCampus" (
        references = [@./esri_hq_building.usda@</EsriHQ>]
    )
    {
        # Local offset (metres) — stays within float32 range
        double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 0, 0)
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate"]
    }

    # ── Different CRS zone in the same scene ─────────────────────────
    def Xform "NewYorkCity" (
        apiSchemas = ["GeospatialCRSBindingAPI"]
        references = [@./crs_library.usda@</CRS/WGS84_UTM18N>]
    )
    {
        uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["!resetXformStack!", "xformOp:translate"]
        # Times Square — UTM 18N coordinates (metres)
        double3 xformOp:translate = (583960, 4507523, 10)

        def Xform "TimesSquareBuilding"
        {
            double3 xformOp:translate = (0, 0, 0)
            uniform token[] xformOpOrder = ["xformOp:translate"]

            def Mesh "Walls"
            {
                int[] faceVertexCounts = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
                int[] faceVertexIndices = [
                    0,1,2,3, 4,7,6,5, 0,4,5,1,
                    1,5,6,2, 2,6,7,3, 4,0,3,7
                ]
                point3f[] points = [
                    (-25,-15,0),(25,-15,0),(25,15,0),(-25,15,0),
                    (-25,-15,60),(25,-15,60),(25,15,60),(-25,15,60)
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Key observations:
- `/World` is bound to UTM 11N (EPSG:32611) — this is the **Target CRS**.
- `/World/EsriCampus` has no CRS binding — it **inherits** UTM 11N from `/World`.
- `/World/NewYorkCity` overrides with UTM 18N (EPSG:32618).
  At runtime, its geometry would be **reprojected** to UTM 11N.
- Mesh vertices (`point3f[]`) are small local offsets.
  Large geospatial positions are in `double3 xformOp:translate`.

### Stage metadata: metersPerUnit and upAxis

The `metersPerUnit` stage metadata defines the unit scale
for the entire stage.
When a CRS uses units other than metres
(e.g., US survey feet for State Plane CRS),
the CRS's unit definition in the WKT string
should be consistent with `metersPerUnit`,
or the runtime must apply a unit conversion.

The `upAxis` metadata ("Y" or "Z") defines the stage's up direction.
Most geospatial CRS conventions use Z-up,
so scenes authored with geospatial CRS
should typically set `upAxis = "Z"`.

The precise interaction between stage units/axes
and CRS-defined units/axes requires further specification
and is flagged as an [open question](#open-questions).

### Transform stack and resetXformStack

The `GeospatialCRSBindingAPI` emits `!resetXformStack!`
at the beginning of the `xformOpOrder` for CRS-bound prims.
This ensures that the `xformOp:translate` value
is interpreted as an **absolute position** in the bound CRS,
not as a relative offset from a parent transform.

Without this reset, USD's standard transform concatenation
would add the geospatial coordinates of parent and child,
producing nonsensical world-space positions.

### Composition arcs

CRS bindings compose through standard USD composition arcs:

- **References:** CRS library prims are imported via `references`.
- **Sublayers:** CRS libraries can be included as sublayers.
- **Inherits:** CRS class prims can be inherited
  (as demonstrated in the POC implementations).
- **Payloads:** CRS bindings survive payload loading/unloading.

The standard USD composition order (LIVRPS) applies;
a stronger arc can override a weaker arc's CRS binding.

### Relationship to UsdGeom

The `GeospatialCRSBindingAPI` is restricted to `UsdGeomXformable` prims.
It does not modify `UsdGeomMesh`, `UsdGeomPoints`, or other geometry schemas.
Geometry prims remain unchanged —
their vertex positions are always local offsets
relative to the nearest ancestor `Xform`.

## Industry use cases

### AECO

Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows require
placing architectural models at surveyed site coordinates.
A hospital designed in Revit or ArchiCAD
must be positioned at its planned construction site
for clash detection, permitting, and construction coordination.

With this proposal, a BIM model exported to USD
retains its real-world position via CRS metadata,
enabling seamless integration with GIS site maps
and other geolocated assets.

### GIS and digital twins

Digital twin platforms aggregate data from dozens of sources
(LiDAR, photogrammetry, BIM, IoT sensors)
into a unified 3D view of a city, campus, or infrastructure network.
All this data arrives in various CRS —
the platform must reproject everything into a common frame.

This proposal provides the standard mechanism
for each USD layer to declare its CRS,
enabling the digital twin platform to compose and reproject
automatically rather than relying on manual coordinate transformations.

### Infrastructure and utilities

Pipeline, rail, and utility networks span hundreds of kilometres,
often crossing multiple UTM zones or State Plane regions.
A single USD stage must compose assets from different CRS zones
and display them correctly in a unified view.

The multi-CRS composition and runtime reprojection
described in this proposal directly address this use case.

### Defense and simulation

Military simulation and training environments
require precise geolocation of terrain, buildings, and vehicles
in CRS tied to national geodetic reference frames.
Dynamic datums and coordinate epochs
(supported via WKT 2's `COORDINATEMETADATA`)
are essential for high-precision positioning.

## Interoperability

### glTF geospatial extension

The Khronos Group is developing a geospatial extension for glTF
that encodes CRS metadata on nodes.
The approach is conceptually similar to this proposal
(CRS definition + binding to scene graph nodes).
Alignment between the USD and glTF approaches
would facilitate round-trip exchange between the two formats.

### IFC and BIM workflows

IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) is the open standard for BIM data.
IFC 5 is evaluating USD as a potential geometry backbone.
IFC's `IfcMapConversion` and `IfcProjectedCRS` entities
map directly to this proposal's `GeospatialCRS` and `GeospatialCRSBindingAPI`.
A standard USD CRS mechanism would simplify IFC-to-USD conversion.

### CityGML and OGC 3D Tiles

CityGML and OGC 3D Tiles both carry CRS metadata.
Converting these formats to USD currently requires
discarding or side-channeling CRS information.
This proposal preserves it as first-class scene data.

## Design considerations

### Why WKT and not bare EPSG codes

The proposal uses full OGC WKT 2 strings
rather than simple EPSG integer codes for several reasons:

1. **Self-contained.**
   A WKT string carries the complete CRS definition.
   No external registry lookup is needed at runtime.

2. **Supports custom CRS.**
   Site calibration grids, local engineering CRS,
   and derived projected CRS have no EPSG code.
   WKT can represent any CRS.

3. **Authority IDs are embedded.**
   The WKT `ID["EPSG", 32611]` clause provides
   the familiar integer code for tools that prefer it,
   so nothing is lost.

4. **Dynamic datums.**
   WKT 2 supports `DYNAMIC[FRAMEEPOCH[...]]` and `EPOCH[...]`
   for time-dependent reference frames — critical for
   high-precision surveying and tectonic-plate-aware applications.

5. **ISO standard.**
   OGC WKT 2 is formally standardized as ISO 19162:2019,
   ensuring long-term stability and broad industry support.

### Why a typed prim and not stage metadata

CRS could theoretically be stored as stage-level metadata
(like `metersPerUnit`).
This was rejected because:

1. **A stage often contains multiple CRS zones.**
   Stage metadata is a single value;
   a prim-based approach supports different CRS
   at different points in the hierarchy.

2. **Composition.**
   Prim-level CRS composes through references and sublayers.
   Stage metadata has limited composition semantics.

3. **Reuse.**
   A CRS prim can be referenced by many scenes.
   Stage metadata must be duplicated.

### Alternate approaches considered

| Approach | Mechanism | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-----------|------|------|
| **A: Primvar** | `asset primvars:geolocation:crs` | Auto-inheritance via primvar system | Requires custom asset-path resolution; non-standard prim types |
| **B: String primvar + inherits** | `string primvars:geolocation:crs:wkt` + `inherits` | Simplest implementation; leverages both inherits and primvar inheritance | WKT duplicated on every inheriting prim in flattened stage |
| **C: Abstract class + plain attribute** | `class` prims with `crs:wkt` attribute | Idiomatic USD class usage | No automatic inheritance for plain attributes; requires manual parent-walking |
| **D: Typed prim + applied API (this proposal)** | `GeospatialCRS` prim + `GeospatialCRSBindingAPI` | Clean separation of definition and usage; reference-based binding; API-driven inheritance | Requires new schema registration |

Approach D was selected because it provides the cleanest separation
of concerns, composes naturally through USD references,
and follows established patterns
(cf. `UsdShadeMaterialBindingAPI`).

The other approaches (A, B, C) were explored in
[proof-of-concept implementations](https://github.com/mistafunk/aousd-geospatial-pocs)
and informed the final design.

### Open questions

1. **Interaction with `metersPerUnit` and `upAxis`.**
   How should the CRS's unit definition interact with `metersPerUnit`?
   Should the runtime enforce consistency, convert automatically,
   or leave it to the authoring tool?

2. **Axis mapping.**
   Geospatial CRS axis orders vary
   (some are Easting/Northing, others Northing/Easting).
   How does this interact with USD's coordinate conventions?

3. **Third-party library abstraction.**
   What is the concrete API for plugging in PROJ, GDAL,
   or other CRS transformation libraries?
   Is this a USD plugin interface or a build-time dependency?

4. **WKT validation.**
   Should OpenUSD validate WKT strings at authoring time?
   The current position is that validation is the responsibility
   of authoring tools, not the USD runtime.

5. **Single-precision geometry.**
   The float32 limitation of `point3f` is a fundamental constraint.
   Collaboration with the Geometry Working Group is needed
   to evaluate double-precision geometry support
   for geospatial-scale scenes.

6. **Reprojection performance.**
   CRS reprojection is computationally expensive.
   What caching, LOD, and batching strategies
   should the Hydra Scene Index Filter employ?

7. **glTF interop.**
   How precisely should the USD and glTF geospatial extensions align?
   Should there be a formal mapping specification?

8. **IFC 5 requirements.**
   What additional CRS features (if any)
   does IFC 5 require that are not yet covered?

### Risks

1. **WKT complexity.**
   WKT strings are verbose and easy to author incorrectly.
   Mitigation: provide standard CRS library files
   and authoring-tool validation.

2. **Third-party dependency.**
   Correct reprojection requires PROJ or an equivalent library.
   If no CRS library is available, the runtime cannot reproject.
   Mitigation: graceful degradation — CRS metadata is preserved
   even without a reprojection engine.

3. **Performance.**
   Per-prim reprojection at render time
   could be expensive for large scenes.
   Mitigation: implement caching, pre-transform at export,
   and batch reprojection in the Scene Index Filter.

4. **Adoption resistance.**
   M&E users who do not need geospatial features
   may perceive this as unnecessary complexity.
   Mitigation: the schemas are optional and additive —
   they do not affect scenes that do not use them.

## Relationship to other proposals

- **[OpenExec](../openexec/README.md):**
  Geospatial reprojection could leverage the OpenExec framework
  for deferred evaluation of CRS transformations.

- **[Semantic Schema](../semantic_schema/README.md):**
  Geospatial prims could carry semantic labels
  (e.g., "building", "road", "terrain") for GIS classification.

- **[Identifier Separation of Concerns](../identifier_separation_of_concerns/README.md):**
  BIM/GIS assets often carry source identifiers
  (IFC GlobalId, GIS feature ID) that should survive
  round-trip through USD.

- **[Revise Use of Layer Metadata](../revise_use_of_layer_metadata/README.md):**
  Relevant to the discussion of whether CRS belongs at
  the stage level vs. prim level.
